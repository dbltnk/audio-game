    we''ve given you access to the Sharada recordings. Bear
    in mind that these are a complete mess, some  files are unusable or have nothing
    to do with the song.


    As always, Nick just batch-named and dumped the files
    on the server...I confide in your legendary tidiness to get a song out of this
    fuckup.


    Once you are ready, you should send the bounce directly to Pavel
    via IM as usual.



    So long,


    Claire'

DIALOGUE SCRIPTING GUIDE

1. BASIC STRUCTURE:
   - Filename (e.g., pavel2.txt) identifies the dialogue
   - Use [MESSAGE HISTORY] to define previous messages
   - Use [LIVE MESSAGES] to define the interactive dialogue
   - Use [ID] for each dialogue segment (e.g., [Pavel_00])
   - {latency: X, timer: Y} sets timing (optional)
   - > for other character's dialogue
   - Numbers (1., 2., etc.) for Vince's response options
   
2. MESSAGE HISTORY:
   Format: content: Message content | author: Vince or Pavel | time: HH:mm
   
3. LIVE MESSAGES (STORYTELLER):
   Format: Number. Brief | Full response | Next dialogue ID
   Example: 1. Yes! (Excited) | Yes, got them and looking forward to listening! | Pavel_01

4. CHARACTER RESPONSES:
   Use < before the response, can be on the next line after an option
   Example: 
   1. Option
      < Response

5. MULTI-LINE TEXT:
   Simply continue on the next line, maintaining indentation

6. MEDIA:
   - Images: [image: filename.jpg] Description
   - Audio: [audio: filename.mp3] Description

7. TIMING (Optional):
   {latency: X, timer: Y} where X and Y are seconds
   Can be placed after segment ID or before a response

8. BRANCHING:
   Use the Next dialogue ID in options to create branches

Remember: 
- Indentation is important for readability but doesn't affect functionality
- Be consistent with your ID naming (e.g., Character_NumberNumber)
- You can have multiple options lead to the same next dialogue

* sort through many unnamed audio files
* move audio layers to sync them
* volume curve, tweaks
* spectrogram
    * find the image amongst many files
* pitch up/down
* find the time of the gunshot amongst many tracks (Phoenix Wright)
* panning left/right
* lyrics sheets -> re-generate voice from text
* EVP / whisper in the tail of a song (enhance)

* to progress send over
    * some text (quiz)
    * a produced audio file (solved puzzle)

* there are lots of personal files
* and old work projects

* climax: you need to get up from the computer and walk around in a scary 3D environment
    * could also work when you drive home from work (FMV footage)

* multiple characters (documentary producer, investigator, band relative) -> goal givers, sometimes conflicting, decide who to give what

##  RAW NOTES

A music restoration horror game

Start now! It's the most important thing
Pick from here and there
Research

A lost song
A professional audio mastering engineer/forensic audio tech
60s? 70s?

Missing parts - vocals emerge
Crime attached to the song 
Open something unspeakable by piecing it back together

Virtual desktop environment

An obscure band that went viral due to an ad/post/video

Now everybody wants to hear more

Two angles/protagonists? Engineer working on restoration and some kind of investigation 

Working against each other- investigator trying to prevent the restoration at some point, while engineer keeps putting it together

Restoration: make a game out of editing (apollo justice!), denoising, spectral processing

Tapes of the album, conversations before and after the recordings

Takes with background info

The gist: piece together a song that will unleash something horrible upon the world

Band had ties to some guru figure

Who was involved in the group?
Make a game out of sorting through takes etc., evidence. The music is evidence

Unreleased
Edit
Tapes
Imprinted

Band: rock? More 'clean image'? That makes it more creepy?

What happens to the engineer?

FMV?

Spectral image in some files (impossible to do back then, but they are still there- how???)

Clues to a crime, a ritual, linked to a song or the album

Have a specific song be the vehicle?

Complete some songs before?

Video footage of band? Or photos?

Children band a la hanson?

Have the tapes there- see them, dusty and such

But work digitally- professional environment, clean desktop, precise

Contrast: investigator: post its on screen, cluttered desktop, some OS issues

Have the entity creep into the computer (phantasmagoria 2)


How does it end?

The entity is unleashed

Investigator prevents engineer from completing the work, but kills him in the process (Article explains)

???

Make decisions by multiple choice answers?

Use of AI in restoration tools

AI 'misled' by entity 

In the end: playing the song entirely, it's a gentle song that hides a terrifying evil
